## Plans
### Future updates
The general progress of this project can be seen on our [Trello Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/N6bLfnaB/lazyjavie-roadmap). Although you can always join our [Discord server](discord.gg/bZ728v4)'s announcement channel for updates about this project, among other projects unrelated to this one.

### Target goal
We want to release the bot as a server-hosted bot similar to [Mee6](https://mee6.xyz) and [Rythm](https://rythm.fm), but on a much smaller scale. There are simply too many bots doing the same thing, we simply cannot compete unless we pull off something amazing.
