# LazyJavie
LazyJavie 2.2 is a multi-purpose Discord Bot instruction set with multiple unique features, many of which are still in development.

## Features
### Private chat with random strangers!
A place where members can privately talk with strangers, anonymously or otherwise. All they have to do is click on a button to queue up!
